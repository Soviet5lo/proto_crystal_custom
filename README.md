# Pokemon Proto Crystal Custom

This is a modification of [Pokemon Spaceworld Crystal] (https://github.com/tshadowknight/proto_crystal) by TSK (tshadowknight), made from the [disassembly of Pokemon Crystal] (https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) by pret.  At this point I'm mostly just doing occasional updates to keep this in sync with upstream.  If you want spoilery details check [README-Detailed.md](README-Detailed.md).  For build instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Changes from Spaceworld Crystal
- Base stats for the spaceworld monsters have been completely redone. (mostly made from pokemon design + movesets in spaceworld, with a few personal touches)
- Movesets for some spaceworld pokemon have been changed to be more similar to their Spaceworld movesets.
- Turbann is now an alternate evolution of Shellder: it evolves via Slowpoketail (used as if it were a evolutionary stone).
- A few wild pokemon location changes.
- Some type changes (Lykwyse Normal/Steel, Parasect Ghost/Grass, Plux Bug/Dark, Turbann Water/Psychic)

## Changes from vanilla Crystal (these are also found in Spaceworld Crystal)
- All pokemon and sprites are replaced with the ones found in the 1997 Spaceworld demo of Pokemon Gold.
- New cries and pokedex info for the Spaceworld Pokemon.
- New base stats and movesets for the Spaceworld Pokemon.
- Make all of the Spaceworld Pokemon available in the wild.
- Update trainer rosters to utilize the Spaceworld Pokemon
- Update events where needed (Sudowoodo -> Belmitt, Shuckle -> Snubull)

## TODO
- Finish up the No-RTC stuff (adding it to makefile, handle the bug catching contest)
- Go over Spaceworld pokemon TMs and change as needed.
- Check and see if the new egg moves fit the revised movesets.

## Quirks
- Base Stats and Movesets are made assuming Physical/Special split, which isn't in Gen 2.
